An Automated Wheelchair for Physically Challenged People using Hand Gesture and Mobile App

# Abstract
Traditional manual wheelchairs are dif icult to use without the help of body strength. This paper presents a model of an automated wheelchair for disabled people. The proposed wheelchair is battery powered and uses an Arduino microcontroller to operate.The device consists of two parts- one is the sender end and another is the receiver end. The sender end records instructions from the userâ€™s dif erent hand gestures which are collected using an MPU-6050 gyro accelerometer sensor. The instructions are continuously recorded and sent to the receiver end using an RF transmitter- nRF24101 through an Arduino microcontroller. In the receiver end, the signal is received by an nRF module which is used to control the wheelchair in a plain surface. Additionally, the device contains a Bluetooth module which can be used as a secondary control system so it can be used by a smartphone application. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is functional under normal circumstances with a fast response time which can be very useful for disable people to commute with.
